This is a tool that allows you to edit Black Ops III's LVI Files, these files dictate bloom and some colour settings.

# Using SunSh1n3

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i><a href="https://discord.gg/RyqyThu" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to join my Discord server to download the latest version.</div>

{% include note.html content="You can load LVI files provided to us by Treyarch and edit them instead of starting from scratch." %}
{% include note.html content="To quickly reload your LVI file in Radiant, you can untick and tick the USE_BLOOM and USE_COLOR boxes in the PBG entity." %}

Using SunSh1n3 is quite simple but the values may be confusing. To begin, simply open the exe, and begin editing values to what you desire. Once done, you can save your LVI file to Black Ops III's `grades` folder and view the result in Radiant.

In the future more documentation on the values may be provided here once they are fully figured out.
