{% include important.html content="This tutorial does not include a customization table and uses a simple XModel override, if you don't know what a customization table is you probably don't need one, if you do and need one, you'll need to set up it up yourself." %}

{% include important.html content="If you get duplicate erros, do not report them to me, fix them yourself, duplicate errors are almost never an issue with an asset package you download unless stated otherwise. **NEVER TICK IGNORE ERRORS FOR DUPLICATE ERRORS.**" %}

To start simply copy over the folders, excluding the screenshots folder, to your Call of Duty: Black Ops III folder.

Next open your map's zone file, this can be done by right clicking your map in Launcher and clicking "Edit Zone File" which will open it in a text editor, or by going to your map's folder and opening the .zone file.

Once opened, you'll want to add the following to it, adding it to the bottom will be fine to make things easy:

```
xmodel,c_zom_der_dempsey_mpc_fb
xmodel,c_zom_der_dempsey_viewbody
xmodel,c_zom_der_dempsey_viewhands
xmodel,c_zom_der_dempsey_viewlegs
xmodel,c_zom_der_nikolai_mpc_fb
xmodel,c_zom_der_nikolai_viewbody
xmodel,c_zom_der_nikolai_viewhands
xmodel,c_zom_der_nikolai_viewlegs
xmodel,c_zom_der_richtofen_mpc_fb
xmodel,c_zom_der_richtofen_viewbody
xmodel,c_zom_der_richtofen_viewhands
xmodel,c_zom_der_richtofen_viewlegs
xmodel,c_zom_der_takeo_mpc_fb
xmodel,c_zom_der_takeo_viewbody
xmodel,c_zom_der_takeo_viewhands
xmodel,c_zom_der_takeo_viewlegs
image,uie_t7_zm_hud_score_char1
image,uie_t7_zm_hud_score_char2
image,uie_t7_zm_hud_score_char3
image,uie_t7_zm_hud_score_char4
```

Next you'll want to go over to `Call of Duty Black Ops III\zone_source\all\assetlist` and open the file `core_common.csv` in any text editor, this is simply one of the files linker will read to determine assets it should ignore, we don't want it to ignore our characters, so we'll want to remove the above lines from this file, either by removing the lines by deleting them, or by adding `// ` to the start of each line to comment them out.

Once done you can simply link your map and you should have working Space Suits, if you run into issues, fully check the log before reporting issues, if you have issues, it's more than likely on your end.
