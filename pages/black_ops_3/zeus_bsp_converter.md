This is a tool that will allow you to convert bsp files produced by Black Ops III's cod2map64 to obj or xmodel_export. These can then be opened in Maya, etc. for creating xcams, etc. or put straight back into APE to reuse in any way you want.

# Using Zeus

{% include note.html content="This tool is primarily provided for Black Ops 3 mappers looking to create cinematics, converting large parts of their maps to models, etc. If you're looking for the tool to do something more, then it's not for you." %}

Using Zeus is quite simple, simply compile your map and then navigate to `BlackOps3\share\raw\maps` and go into the mp or zm folder and find the d3dbsp file for your map, then drag it onto the tool.

If you would like to convert a particular part of your map, or a prefab, you can pack them into a prefab, then pull just that map file onto Zeus to invoke Black Ops 3's compiler, a d3dbsp file in the maps folder will be produced that Zeus will accept.

In the future some further options for filtering geo, etc. will be provided.
